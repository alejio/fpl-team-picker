# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) analysis suite that provides both season-start team building and weekly gameweek management. The project implements a comprehensive mathematical framework combining Poisson distributions, team ratings, player performance metrics, fixture analysis, and live data integration for optimal FPL decision making.

The project is structured as a Python package with modular architecture and provides two main interfaces via Marimo notebooks for interactive data analysis.

]

[tool.uv.sources]
fpl-dataset-builder = { path = "../fpl-dataset-builder", editable = true }
```

## Core Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture principles** with clear separation between domain logic, infrastructure, and presentation layers. This design enables frontend flexibility and comprehensive testing while maintaining code quality.

### 1. Domain Layer (`fpl_team_picker/domain/`) - **Frontend-Agnostic Business Logic**

The domain layer contains all business logic and is completely independent of any framework or UI technology.

#### Domain Services - **Pure Business Logic**

orchestration_service = DataOrchestrationService()
gameweek_data = orchestration_service.load_gameweek_data(target_gameweek=10, form_window=5)
# Returns: Guaranteed valid data dictionary - all downstream operations are deterministic
```

**Expected Points Service** (`expected_points_service.py`)
```python
from fpl_team_picker.domain.services import ExpectedPointsService

# Pure XP calculation - works with any frontend
xp_service = ExpectedPointsService()
players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(
    gameweek_data, use_ml_model=False
)
# Returns: 1GW + 5GW expected points with model metadata
```

**Transfer Optimization Service** (`transfer_optimization_service.py`)
```python
from fpl_team_picker.domain.services import TransferOptimizationService

# Smart transfer scenarios - 0-3 transfers with constraint support

chip_service = ChipAssessmentService()
chip_recommendations = chip_service.assess_all_chips(
    current_squad=squad_with_xp,
    all_players=players_with_xp,
    fixtures=fixtures,
    available_chips=["wildcard", "bench_boost"]
)

        from fpl_team_picker.domain.services import ExpectedPointsService
        xp_service = ExpectedPointsService()
        players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(gameweek_data)

        # Pure presentation
        xp_results_display = create_xp_results_display(players_with_xp, mo)
    else:

# Or run directly with Marimo
marimo run fpl_team_picker/interfaces/season_planner.py
marimo run fpl_team_picker/interfaces/gameweek_manager.py
marimo run fpl_team_picker/interfaces/ml_xp_experiment.py
```

## ML Model Development Data Sources

### Historical Gameweek Performance Data
The fpl-dataset-builder project provides comprehensive historical data for ML model development via the `FPLDataClient`:

**Available Historical Data:**
- `get_gameweek_performance(gw)` - All players' performance for specific gameweek
- `get_player_gameweek_history(player_id, start_gw, end_gw)` - Historical performance for individual players
- `get_my_picks_history(start_gw, end_gw)` - Historical team selections across gameweeks

**Core Performance Fields (Leak-Free for ML Training):**
- **Basic Stats**: `total_points`, `minutes`, `goals_scored`, `assists`, `clean_sheets`, `goals_conceded`
- **Advanced Metrics**: `expected_goals`, `expected_assists`, `ict_index`, `bps`, `influence`, `creativity`, `threat`
- **Context**: `team_id`, `opponent_team`, `was_home`, `value` (player price at time of gameweek)

**ML Feature Engineering (Temporal Validation):**
The ML experiment interface implements proper temporal validation to prevent data leakage:
- Historical per-90 metrics calculated from cumulative data up to each training gameweek
- Position-specific modeling with separate XGBoost models for GKP/DEF/MID/FWD
- Ensemble predictions combining general + position-specific model outputs
- Leak-free features: `xG90_historical`, `xA90_historical`, `points_per_90`, `bps_historical`, `ict_index_historical`

**Usage Example:**
```python
from client import FPLDataClient

client = FPLDataClient()

# Get training data for multiple gameweeks with proper temporal validation
for gw in range(2, 6):  # GW2-5 for training
    gw_data = client.get_gameweek_performance(gw)
    # Calculate cumulative historical stats up to previous gameweek only
    # Use for training to predict current gameweek performance
```

## Expected Points Models

### Multi-Gameweek Model (Season Planning)
**Fast implementation for season-start team building:**

1. **League Baselines** - Î¼_home = 1.43, Î¼_away = 1.15 (Premier League averages)
2. **Team Strength Ratings** - Dynamic calculations with historical baselines
3. **Enhanced Minutes Model** - SBP + availability + position-specific durability
4. **Multi-Gameweek xP** - 5-week horizon with temporal weighting (1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6)

### Single Gameweek Model (Weekly Management)
**Form-weighted predictions with live data integration:**

1. **Live Data Integration** - Real-time performance and market intelligence
2. **Form-Weighted Calculations** - 70% recent form + 30% season average
3. **Dynamic Performance Adjustments** - Form multipliers and momentum tracking

### ML-Based Expected Points Model (Experimental)
**XGBoost machine learning approach with leak-free temporal validation:**

1. **Enhanced Feature Engineering** - Historical per-90 metrics with cumulative calculations
2. **Position-Specific Models** - Separate XGBoost models for GKP, DEF, MID, FWD positions
3. **Ensemble Predictions** - Combines general + position-specific model outputs
4. **Temporal Validation** - Proper train/test splits preventing data leakage
5. **Hyperparameter Optimization** - Tuned XGBoost parameters for FPL prediction accuracy

**Key Features:**
- Uses only historical data available at prediction time (no future information)
- Incorporates gameweek-by-gameweek performance history from fpl-dataset-builder
- Validates against actual FPL results with performance metrics
- Experimental interface for model development and accuracy testing

```

## Performance Benchmark

**2024-25 FPL Winner**: 2,810 points (74 points per gameweek average)
- Target: 5-week xP projections should align with ~370 points (5 Ã— 74) for competitive squads
- Validation: Premium players should project 8-12 xP per gameweek, budget options 4-7 xP

## Clean Architecture Patterns & Frontend Migration

### **Boundary Validation Pattern - "Fail Fast, Validate Once"**

The system implements a sophisticated validation pattern where all data validation occurs at the boundary, ensuring deterministic business logic:

```python
# DataOrchestrationService - THE validation boundary
def load_gameweek_data(self, target_gameweek: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """FAIL FAST if data is bad - guarantee clean data downstream"""

    # Comprehensive validation here
    if len(teams) != 20:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid team data: expected 20 teams, got {len(teams)}")

    # Return: "Clean data dictionary - guaranteed to be valid"
    return validated_data

# ExpectedPointsService - Trusts the data contract
def calculate_expected_points(self, gameweek_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Args: gameweek_data - guaranteed clean data
    Returns: DataFrame with expected points - deterministic"""

    # No validation needed - trust the contract
    players = gameweek_data["players"]  # Known to be valid
    return mathematical_transformation(players)
```

### **Frontend Migration Readiness**

The clean architecture enables seamless migration to any frontend technology:

```python
# 1. Current: Marimo Notebook
@app.cell
def _(gameweek_input, mo):
    orchestration_service = DataOrchestrationService()
    gameweek_data = orchestration_service.load_gameweek_data(gameweek_input.value)

    xp_service = ExpectedPointsService()
    players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(gameweek_data)

    return create_marimo_display(players_with_xp)

# 2. Future: FastAPI Backend
@app.post("/analyze-gameweek")
def analyze_gameweek(request: GameweekRequest):
    orchestration_service = DataOrchestrationService()
    gameweek_data = orchestration_service.load_gameweek_data(request.gameweek)

    xp_service = ExpectedPointsService()
    players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(gameweek_data)

    return {"status": "success", "data": players_with_xp.to_dict()}

# 3. Future: React Frontend (via API)
const GameweekAnalysis = ({ gameweek }) => {
    const { data: analysisData } = useQuery(
        ['gameweek-analysis', gameweek],
        () => fetch(`/api/analyze-gameweek`, {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({ gameweek })

# 4. Future: CLI Interface
def cli_analyze_gameweek(gameweek: int):
    orchestration_service = DataOrchestrationService()
    gameweek_data = orchestration_service.load_gameweek_data(gameweek)

    xp_service = ExpectedPointsService()
    players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(gameweek_data)

    print(format_cli_table(players_with_xp))
```

### **Testing Strategy**

**Domain Service Testing** - Complete isolation from UI:
```python
# tests/domain/services/test_integration.py
def test_expected_points_service_integration(data_service, xp_service):
    """Test XP service with real data - no UI dependencies"""
    gameweek_data = data_service.load_gameweek_data(target_gameweek=1)

    players_with_xp = xp_service.calculate_combined_results(gameweek_data)

    assert isinstance(players_with_xp, pd.DataFrame)
    assert players_with_xp["xP"].min() >= 0
    assert players_with_xp["xP"].max() <= 20
```

**Interface Compatibility Testing**:
```python
# tests/interfaces/test_marimo_compatibility.py
def test_gameweek_manager_loads_without_errors():
    """Ensure marimo interface works with domain services"""
    # Test marimo notebook can import and use domain services
    from fpl_team_picker.domain.services import DataOrchestrationService
    service = DataOrchestrationService()
    assert service is not None
```

## Development Workflow

### **Current Development (Clean Architecture)**
1. **Season Start**: Use season planner for initial 15-player squad building
2. **Weekly Planning**: Use clean gameweek manager (969 lines) with domain service orchestration
3. **Post-Gameweek**: Analyze results using domain services independently
4. **ML Model Development**: Use ML experiment interface for model improvement
5. **Domain Service Development**: Add/modify business logic in isolated domain services
6. **Frontend Experimentation**: Build new interfaces using existing domain services

### **Future Development (Multi-Frontend)**
1. **FastAPI Backend**: Expose domain services as REST API endpoints
2. **React Frontend**: Build modern web interface consuming REST API
3. **Mobile Development**: iOS/Android apps using same business logic via API
4. **CLI Tools**: Command-line utilities for power users and automation
5. **Third-Party Integrations**: Enable other developers to use FPL analysis services

### **Testing & Validation Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Domain service testing (business logic)
pytest tests/domain/services/ -v

# 2. Integration testing (end-to-end)
pytest tests/domain/services/test_integration.py -v

# 3. Interface compatibility testing
pytest tests/interfaces/ -v

# 4. Code quality and formatting
ruff check fpl_team_picker/ --fix
marimo check fpl_team_picker/interfaces/ --fix
```

The clean architecture transformation enables rapid iteration across multiple frontends while maintaining a single source of truth for all FPL analysis logic. Domain services can be developed, tested, and deployed independently of any specific UI technology.
