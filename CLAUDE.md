## Project Overview

This is a Fantasy Premier League (FPL) analysis suite that provides both season-start team building and weekly gameweek management. The project implements a comprehensive mathematical framework combining Poisson distributions, team ratings, player performance metrics, fixture analysis, and live data integration for optimal FPL decision making.

The project is structured as a Python package with modular architecture and provides two main interfaces via Marimo notebooks for interactive data analysis.

## Data Loading

This project uses the fpl-dataset-builder database client library for all data operations.

### Usage
```python
from client import FPLDataClient

client = FPLDataClient()
players = client.get_current_players()
teams = client.get_current_teams()

marimo run fpl_team_picker/interfaces/ml_xp_experiment.py
```

## ML Model Development Data Sources

### Historical Gameweek Performance Data
The fpl-dataset-builder project provides comprehensive historical data for ML model development via the `FPLDataClient`:

**Available Historical Data:**
- `get_gameweek_performance(gw)` - All players' performance for specific gameweek
- `get_player_gameweek_history(player_id, start_gw, end_gw)` - Historical performance for individual players
- `get_my_picks_history(start_gw, end_gw)` - Historical team selections across gameweeks

**Core Performance Fields (Leak-Free for ML Training):**
- **Basic Stats**: `total_points`, `minutes`, `goals_scored`, `assists`, `clean_sheets`, `goals_conceded`
- **Advanced Metrics**: `expected_goals`, `expected_assists`, `ict_index`, `bps`, `influence`, `creativity`, `threat`
- **Context**: `team_id`, `opponent_team`, `was_home`, `value` (player price at time of gameweek)

**ML Feature Engineering (Temporal Validation):**
The ML experiment interface implements proper temporal validation to prevent data leakage:
- Historical per-90 metrics calculated from cumulative data up to each training gameweek
- Position-specific modeling with separate XGBoost models for GKP/DEF/MID/FWD
- Ensemble predictions combining general + position-specific model outputs
- Leak-free features: `xG90_historical`, `xA90_historical`, `points_per_90`, `bps_historical`, `ict_index_historical`

**Usage Example:**
```python
from client import FPLDataClient

client = FPLDataClient()

# Get training data for multiple gameweeks with proper temporal validation
for gw in range(2, 6):  # GW2-5 for training
    gw_data = client.get_gameweek_performance(gw)
    # Calculate cumulative historical stats up to previous gameweek only
    # Use for training to predict current gameweek performance
```

## Expected Points Models

3. **Enhanced Minutes Model** - SBP + availability + position-specific durability
4. **Multi-Gameweek xP** - 5-week horizon with temporal weighting (1.0, 0.9, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6)

- Squad composition: 2 GKP, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD
- Â£100m budget limit
- Max 3 players per real team
- Valid formations for starting 11

## Configuration

The project uses a comprehensive configuration system. Create `config.json` to override defaults:

```json
{
  "xp_model": {
    "form_weight": 0.7,
    "form_window": 5
  },
  "team_strength": {
    "historical_transition_gw": 8
  },
  "optimization": {
    "transfer_cost": 4.0,
    "max_transfers": 3
  }
}
```

Environment variables can override any setting:
```bash
export FPL_XP_MODEL_FORM_WEIGHT=0.8
export FPL_TEAM_STRENGTH_HISTORICAL_TRANSITION_GW=10
```

## Performance Benchmark

**2024-25 FPL Winner**: 2,810 points (74 points per gameweek average)
- Target: 5-week xP projections should align with ~370 points (5 Ã— 74) for competitive squads
- Validation: Premium players should project 8-12 xP per gameweek, budget options 4-7 xP

## Development Workflow

1. **Season Start**: Use season planner for initial 15-player squad building
2. **Weekly Planning**: Use gameweek manager for lineup and transfer decisions, including chip assessment analysis
3. **Post-Gameweek**: Analyze results and validate model predictions
4. **ML Model Development**: Use ML experiment interface for expected points model improvement
   - Train models on historical gameweek performance data
   - Validate with proper temporal splits to prevent data leakage
   - Compare ML predictions against actual FPL results
   - Iterate on feature engineering and hyperparameter optimization
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Update configuration and model parameters

The modular architecture supports rapid iteration and testing of different strategies while maintaining code quality and type safety. The ML experiment interface provides a dedicated environment for developing and validating machine learning approaches to expected points prediction using comprehensive historical data from the fpl-dataset-builder.
