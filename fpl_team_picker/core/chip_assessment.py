"""
FPL Chip Assessment Module

Provides heuristic-based analysis for optimal chip usage timing:
- Wildcard: Analyze transfer opportunities and fixture runs
- Free Hit: Detect double gameweeks and squad improvement potential
- Bench Boost: Calculate bench strength for target gameweek
- Triple Captain: Identify optimal captaincy candidates

Uses simple heuristics rather than complex optimization for fast analysis.
