"""
FPL Machine Learning Expected Points (ML-XP) Service

Advanced ML-based XP predictions using pre-trained sklearn pipelines.
REQUIRES pre-trained model artifacts (no on-the-fly training).

Key Features:
- Pre-trained sklearn pipelines for production deployment
- Rich 80-feature set: 5GW rolling windows, team context, ownership trends, value analysis
- Position-specific models (optional) for GKP/DEF/MID/FWD
- Leak-free temporal features (all features use past data only)
- Loads .joblib model artifacts trained via TPOT or ml_xp_experiment.py
- Drop-in replacement for old MLExpectedPointsService (same interface)

Train models using:
  - TPOT: scripts/tpot_pipeline_optimizer.py --start-gw 1 --end-gw 8
  - Manual: ml_xp_experiment.py interface
