### Strategic Profile
- **Archetype:** Value-Seeking Reactor
- **Risk Level:** Medium-High

- **Transfer Discipline:** Moderate
- **Captaincy Strategy:** Weak

### Strengths
✅ Value extraction (banked £7.5m total)
✅ Fixture awareness when applied (GW7: 69 pts)
✅ Willingness to take calculated risks

### Weaknesses
❌ Inconsistent fixture targeting
❌ Reactive strategy (GW9 overhaul)
❌ Poor captaincy pattern (6 different captains)
❌ Too many differentials, missing template safety

## Best Gameweek
**GW7: 69 points** - Multiple 🟢 fixtures aligned perfectly

## Worst Gameweek
**GW6: 40 points** - Brought in Guéhi vs Liverpool 🔴, poor fixture awareness

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Stick with Haaland captaincy** for template fixtures
2. **Check fixture difficulty** before every transfer
3. **Plan 2-3 GWs ahead** to avoid reactive moves
4. **Reduce differential risk** - add more template players

### Long-Term Strategy
1. **Develop fixture-first philosophy** - always prioritize fixtures
2. **Build template core** - Haaland, Salah, Arsenal defense
3. **Use differentials selectively** - only when clear advantage
4. **Improve transfer timing** - avoid hits, plan ahead

## Predicted Finish
**3.5M - 5M** (with current strategy)
**2M - 3M** (with improvements)

## Next Steps
- Review strategy documents
- Implement recommendations
- Re-analyze at GW15 to track improvements
